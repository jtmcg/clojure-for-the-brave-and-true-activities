# Chapter 4 Exercises

*Note: Many of these are yet to be added. I'll add them when I get to them.*

## Exercise 1

Turn the result of the `glitter_filter` function into a list of names.

## Exercise 2

Write a function, append, which will append a new suspect to the list of suspects.

## Exercise 3

Write a function, *`validate`*, which will check that `:name` and `:glitter-index` are present when you `append`. The `validate` function should accept two arguments: a map of keywords to validating functions, similar to `conversions`, and the record to be validated.

## Exercise 4

Write a function that will take your list of maps and convert it back to a  CSV string. You'll need to use the `clojure.string/join` function.
